    <h2>What is MongoDB RAG?</h2>
    <p>
      <span class="highlight">What is retrieval-augmented generation?</span> 
     Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a popular generative AI framework that enhances the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by incorporating relevant, up-to-date information during the generation process. This approach allows LLMs to supplement their pre-trained knowledge with current, domain-specific data. RAG is a cost-effective solution to customize an LLM for specific use cases without the expensive and time-consuming process of fine-tuning or retraining the entire model.

Retrieval-augmented generation for more intelligent AI
Retrieval-augmented generation allows organizations to leverage general-purpose large language models for specialized applications without needing expensive, custom-trained models. RAG directly addresses the fundamental limitations of these models by augmenting queries with current, domain-specific information to enhance generation capabilities. This enables organizations to incorporate real-time information, proprietary datasets, and specialized documentation that is not part of the original model training. By transparently providing evidence with responses, RAG improves trust and reduces the risk of hallucinations.

What are large language models?
LLMs are a form of artificial intelligence designed to understand and produce human-like text. As an advanced application of Natural Language Processing (NLP), LLMs can learn patterns, structures, and grammar from massive amounts of training data, enabling them to generate coherent responses to user prompts. The strength of LLMs lies in their ability to perform a wide range of language generation tasks without the need for task-specific training. This makes them versatile tools for applications such as chatbots, translation, content creation, and summarization.

The limitations of large language models
A large language model is a complex neural network that learns from analyzing massive training datasets. These models require substantial computational resources, making them extremely expensive and time-consuming to develop. Moreover, the specialized infrastructure required for hosting and maintaining custom LLMs creates significant financial barriers, limiting their accessibility to only well-resourced organizations with considerable technological investments.

LLMs are great at answering questions about historical content, but their knowledge is constrained by the limitations of their training data. This renders them less effective for queries requiring up-to-date knowledge, as they cannot answer queries about recent events without model retraining.

Similarly, LLMs cannot natively answer questions about internal company documentation or other domain-specific datasets unique to a particular organization. This limitation creates significant challenges for businesses seeking to leverage AI technologies that require deep, specialized knowledge specific to their needs.

These limitations highlight another challenge of LLMs: hallucinations. Without verifiable information, language models can generate confident, plausible-sounding, entirely fabricated responses. This tendency to produce convincing but false information creates significant risks for applications requiring accuracy and reliability. </p>

    </p>

    <h2>Benefits of retrieval-augmented generation
</h2>
    <p>
RAG has become popular because of its relatively simple architecture coupled with significant performance improvements.

Cost-effective
RAG allows organizations to use general-purpose pre-trained models for specialized applications without the expense of developing custom-trained models. Effective retrieval lowers API costs by ensuring that only necessary information is included to optimize for LLMs that charge per token.

Domain customization
RAG enables organizations to tailor pre-trained models to specific domains by integrating specialized knowledge libraries. This allows models to generate answers about proprietary and industry-specific documentation without customized model training. Fine-tuning can provide similar benefits but requires significantly more time, cost, and maintenance.

Real-time insights
RAG enables large language models to access and generate responses using current information by dynamically retrieving up-to-date data from external sources. This overcomes the knowledge limitations of static training datasets, allowing models to provide insights into recent events and emerging trends.

Transparency
RAG improves AI response reliability by providing source citations and evidence for generated content. By linking each response to specific sources in the knowledge base, RAG allows users to verify the origin and accuracy of information, reducing the risk of hallucinations and building trust in AI-generated outputs.

Adaptability
One key advantage of RAG is its ability to adapt easily to new state-of-the-art models. As advancements in language models or retrieval techniques emerge, organizations can swap in newer models or modify retrieval strategies without overhauling the entire system. This flexibility ensures that a RAG system can stay up-to-date with cutting-edge technology.

How does retrieval-augmented generation work?
RAG consists of three distinct phases: ingestion, retrieval, and generation.

Data ingestion
During ingestion, organizations prepare their knowledge base for retrieval. Source data is collected from various repositories such as internal documentation, databases, or external resources. These documents are then cleaned, formatted, and split into smaller, manageable chunks. Each chunk is converted into a vector representation using an embedding model, which captures the semantic meaning of the text. These vectors are stored in vector databases that enable efficient semantic search and retrieval.

Information retrieval
When a user submits a query, the system retrieves relevant context before generation. The query is transformed into a vector representation using the same embedding model used during ingestion. Vector search will search the database for the most semantically similar document chunks to the query. Additional filtering, ranking, or re-weighting techniques may be applied to ensure that only the most relevant information is retrieved, improving the accuracy of the final response.

Generation
Once the relevant context is retrieved, an augmented prompt is constructed using the original prompt, the same retrieved passages, and specific instructions. The LLM processes this prompt to generate a response that synthesizes its pre-trained knowledge with the retrieved content. This approach ensures that the response is informed by external data sources and aligned with the userâ€™s intent, leading to a more accurate answer.     

    <h2>Key concepts for retrieval-augmented generation</h2>
    <p>Chunking
Chunking is a component of the data ingestion process that enhances system accuracy while reducing costs. It involves breaking large pieces of content into smaller, manageable segments to prepare them for retrieval. The goal is to create meaningful and fully contextualized chunks, ensuring they retain enough information to be useful while minimizing redundancy.

Effective chunking balances granularity and completeness, allowing the system to retrieve relevant information without overwhelming the LLM with unnecessary details. Well-structured chunks improve retrieval precision, reduce token usage, and lead to more accurate and cost-efficient responses.

Embedding models
Embedding models convert data into numerical representations called vectors that capture semantic meaning. This enables the system to understand relationships between words, phrases, and documents, enhancing the accuracy of retrieving relevant information.

During ingestion, the embedding model processes each chunk of data, transforming it into a vector before storing it in a vector database. When a user submits a query, it is converted into a vector using the same embedding model.

Different types of embedding models support various use cases. General-purpose models work well for broad applications, while domain-specific models are tailored to industries like legal, medical, or finance, improving retrieval accuracy in specialized fields. Multimodal models go beyond text processing to handle images, audio, and other data types, enabling more advanced retrieval capabilities. Some models can create a numerical representation of text that can be compared directly against an image or video for truly advanced multimodal retrieval.

Semantic search
Semantic search improves information retrieval by focusing on the meaning behind a userâ€™s query, significantly improving keyword search. Using embeddings, both queries and documents are converted into vectors that capture semantic meaning. When a user submits a query, the vector database searches to find the most relevant documents, even if the exact query terms arenâ€™t directly present in the content.

This approach enables better contextual understanding, ensuring more accurate and relevant results. By recognizing synonyms, related concepts, and word variations, semantic search enhances the user experience and reduces ambiguity, providing results that better match the user's intent.

Reranking
Reranking is a technique used to improve the relevance of search results after an initial retrieval phase. Once a set of documents is retrieved, a reranking model reorders them based on their relevance to the user's query. This model can leverage additional features such as document quality, contextual relevance, or machine learning-based scoring to refine the results.

Reranking helps prioritize the most useful and contextually appropriate information, improving accuracy and user satisfaction. It is especially useful when the initial retrieval phase may return a broad range of results, allowing the system to fine-tune the selection and present the most relevant answers.

Prompt engineering
Prompt engineering involves carefully crafting the input given to an LLM to guide its output in the desired direction. By structuring prompts effectively, you can ensure that the model generates more accurate, relevant, and appropriate responses. This process involves including clear instructions, relevant context, and sometimes examples to help the model understand the task.

In retrieval-augmented generation, prompt engineering plays a key role in combining retrieved documents with the original user query to produce coherent and precise responses. Well-engineered prompts reduce ambiguity, minimize irrelevant information, and ensure the model aligns with the userâ€™s intent, leading to higher-quality outputs.

Optimizing your retrieval-augmented generation application
RAG solutions can be optimized to deliver higher accuracy and an overall improved experience for end users.

Optimizing information retrieval
Information retrieval for RAG can be improved through several strategies. First, review chunking techniques to ensure documents are split into meaningful, contextually relevant segments. Next, choose the right embedding model to capture the semantic meaning of your content. Domain-specific models may offer better results for certain use cases. While semantic search is most commonly used, consider whether keyword search or a hybrid approach can improve retrieval.

Additionally, apply reranking methods after initial retrieval to refine the accuracy of results. It's also crucial to adjust the number of documents retrieved: too many can introduce noise, while too few may miss important context. Finding the right balance helps improve retrieval performance and relevance.

Optimizing answer generation
Improving language generation in RAG can be achieved through several key approaches. First, focus on prompt engineering to structure queries and context in a way that guides the language model to generate more accurate and relevant responses. Clear instructions, context, and examples help reduce ambiguity and improve output quality. Next, evaluate different models or domain-specific LLMs to ensure the generated responses align with the nuances of your specific use case, improving relevance and accuracy. Additionally, tunable model parameters like temperature should be considered to control the creativity of model responses.

Optimizing for production scale
Ensure your RAG system is ready for production by choosing best-in-class vendors for your key application components.

For your vector database, opt for a platform that provides highly efficient search and indexing capabilities, particularly one that supports scalable, fast Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search. Advanced vector databases may also support metadata filtering, which can improve accuracy and speed by narrowing down search results based on additional contextual information. This will enable your system to retrieve relevant documents quickly, even as the dataset grows.

When choosing an embedding model, it's important to balance the high dimensionality of vectors with efficient storage and retrieval. While higher-dimensional embeddings capture richer semantic relationships, they come with increased computational cost, storage requirements, and slower retrieval times.

Additionally, when selecting a Large Language Model (LLM) for the generation component, ensure it aligns with the specific needs of your use case. LLMs should be capable of accurately interpreting the retrieved information and generating coherent, contextually relevant responses. The choice of LLM also impacts the overall cost and performance of the systemâ€”larger models may deliver better accuracy but at the cost of higher latency and computational demands. It's crucial to assess your response time, output quality, and infrastructure requirements to select an LLM that strikes the right balance between performance and efficiency.

Challenges of retrieval-augmented generation
One of the key challenges of RAG is the difficulty in centralizing and organizing content for effective retrieval. RAG systems require access to vast amounts of data across diverse domains, but organizing this content in a way that allows the model to efficiently retrieve the most relevant and up-to-date information is a complex task. Data can be spread across different platforms, formats, and databases, making it difficult to ensure comprehensive coverage and accuracy. Additionally, ensuring consistency across multiple sources is crucial. The retrieved information may be contradictory, outdated, or incomplete, which can muddle the knowledge base and undermine the quality and reliability of generated responses. These challenges highlight the need for more sophisticated indexing and retrieval systems to enable RAG models to pull in the best possible content and generate relevant, accurate outputs.

Another significant challenge is RAG's current limitation to answering questions rather than performing more complex tasks. While RAG systems excel at generating responses based on retrieved information, they struggle with executing actions beyond answering queries or generating content. This constraint arises because RAG is primarily designed to pull in relevant data from external sources and provide outputs based on that data rather than interact with or manipulate real-world environments. As a result, while RAG models can assist in information retrieval and content generation, their ability to carry out tasks like problem-solving or decision-making remains underdeveloped, limiting their potential for more dynamic applications.

Creating memory-enhanced interactive retrieval-augment generation
Enhancing RAG with memory expands its ability to create a more interactive experience by remembering key details and context from past interactions. Traditional RAG systems typically respond to queries without retaining information across multiple exchanges, leading to a disjointed experience. By integrating memory mechanisms, RAG systems could store relevant facts, preferences, or insights from current and previous conversations, allowing them to recall this information as needed. This enables the system to offer more personalized, context-aware responses and create a more seamless experience. Over time, the system builds a deeper understanding of the userâ€™s needs, adapting its responses to be more relevant and engaging, making the experience feel like an ongoing conversation rather than a series of isolated queries.

The future of retrieval-augmented generation and generative AI
New techniques within RAG will continue to emerge, enhancing its ability to retrieve and generate information in more efficient, adaptive, and intelligent ways. One key area of growth is the development of advanced retrieval mechanisms, enabling RAG systems to dynamically access a broader range of sources, including specialized databases, unstructured content, and real-time information. These improvements will make RAG systems more contextually aware, allowing them to generate highly relevant and accurate outputs across various domains.

At the same time, integrating new generative AI agentic capabilities will empower AI systems to perform problem-solving, data analysis, and decision-making tasks. These agentic systems will not only retrieve and generate responses but also take actions based on the information they gather, making them more interactive, self-sufficient, and intelligent. As a result, RAG will become central to applications like automated research, personalized recommendations, and interactive virtual assistants, driving a new era of responsive and proactive AI.

Fine-tuning vs. retrieval-augmented generation
Fine-tuning is a process where a language model is modified through additional training on new content, essentially teaching the model new knowledge or behaviors that become permanently embedded in its parametric memory. This approach requires significant computational resources and expertise, has limited capacity for new information due to model size constraints, and any changes made are permanent and can't be easily updated. A fine-tuned model can provide domain-specific results but has significant training time requirements and cost implications, making it difficult to keep up-to-date.

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) dynamically retrieves content not part of the training data before the language generation occurs. This allows RAG models to incorporate new data without altering the modelâ€™s underlying parameters, making it more flexible and scalable with the need for knowledge-intensive tasks like fine-tuning.

    <h2>Voyage AI</h2>
    <p>AI is reshaping industries, redefining customer experiences, and transforming how businesses innovate, operate, and compete. While much of the focus is on frontier models, a fundamental challenge lies in dataâ€”how it is stored, retrieved, and made useful for AI applications. The democratization of AI-powered software depends on building on top of the right abstractions, yet today, creating useful, real-time AI applications at scale is not feasible for most organizations.

The challenge isnâ€™t just complexityâ€”itâ€™s trust. AI models are probabilistic, meaning their outputs arenâ€™t deterministic and predictable. This is easily evident in the hallucination problem in chatbots today, and becomes even more critical with the rise of agents, where AI systems make autonomous decisions. Development teams need the ability to control, shape, and ground generated outputs to align with their objectives and ensure accuracy.

AI-powered search and retrieval is a powerful tool that extracts relevant contextual data from specific sources, augmenting AI models to generate reliable and accurate responses or take responsible and safe actions, as seen in the prominent retrieval augmented generation (RAG) approach. At the core of AI-powered retrieval are embedding generation and rerankingâ€”two key AI components that capture the semantic meaning of data and assess the relevance of queries and results. We believe embedding generation and reranking, as well as AI-powered search, belong in the database layer, simplifying the stack and creating a more reliable foundation for AI applications. By bringing more intelligence into the database, we help businesses mitigate hallucinations, improve trustworthiness, and unlock AIâ€™s full potential at scale.

The most impactful applications require a flexible, intelligent, and scalable data foundation. Thatâ€™s why weâ€™re excited to announce the acquisition of Voyage AI, a leader in embedding and reranking models that dramatically improve accuracy through AI-powered search and retrieval. This move isnâ€™t just about adding AI capabilitiesâ€”itâ€™s about redefining the database for the AI era.

Why this matters: The future of AI is built on better relevance and accuracy in data
AI is probabilisticâ€”itâ€™s not built like traditional software with pre-defined rules and logic. Instead, it generates responses or takes action based on how the AI model is trained and what data is retrieved. However, due to the probabilistic nature of the technology, AI can hallucinate. Hallucinations are a direct consequence of poor or imprecise retrievalâ€”when AI lacks access to the right data, it generates plausible but incorrect information. This is a critical barrier to AI adoption, especially in enterprises and for mission-critical use cases where accuracy is non-negotiable.

This makes retrieving the most relevant data essential for AI applications to deliver high-quality, contextually accurate results. Today, developers rely on a patchwork of separate components to build AI-powered applications. Sub-optimal choices of these components, such as embedding models, can yield low-relevancy data retrieval and low-quality generated outputs. This fragmented approach is complex, costly, inefficient, and cumbersome for developers.

With Voyage AI, MongoDB solves this challenge by making AI-powered search and retrieval native to the database. Instead of implementing workarounds or managing separate systems, developers can generate high-quality embeddings from real-time operational data, store vectors, perform semantic search, and refine resultsâ€”all within MongoDB. This eliminates complexity and delivers higher accuracy, lower latency, and a streamlined developer experience.
What Voyage AI brings to MongoDB

By integrating Voyage AIâ€™s retrieval capabilities into MongoDB, weâ€™re helping organizations more easily build AI applications with greater accuracy and reliabilityâ€”without unnecessary complexity.

How Voyage AI will be integrated into MongoDB
We are integrating Voyage AI with MongoDB in three phases. In the first phase, Voyage AIâ€™s text embedding, multi-modal embedding, and reranking models will remain widely available through Voyage AIâ€™s current APIs and via the AWS and Azure Marketplacesâ€”ensuring developers can continue to use their best-in-class embedding and reranking capabilities. We will also invest in the scalability and enterprise readiness of the platform to support the increased adoption of Voyage AIâ€™s models.

Next, we will seamlessly embed Voyage AIâ€™s capabilities into MongoDB Atlas, starting with an auto-embedding service for Vector Search, which will handle embedding generation automatically. Native reranking will follow, allowing developers to boost retrieval accuracy instantly. We also plan to expand domain-specific AI capabilities to better support different industries (e.g., financial services, legal, etc.) or use cases (e.g., code generation).

Finally, we will advance AI-powered retrieval with enhanced multi-modal capabilities, enabling seamless retrieval and ranking of text, images, and video. We also plan to introduce instruction-tuned models, allowing developers to refine search behavior using simple prompts instead of complex fine-tuning. This will be complemented by embedding lifecycle management in MongoDB Atlas, ensuring continuous updates and real-time optimization for AI applications.

What this means for developers and businesses
AI-powered applications need more than a database that just stores, processes, and persists dataâ€”they need a database that actively improves retrieval accuracy, scales seamlessly, and eliminates operational friction. With Voyage AI, MongoDB redefines whatâ€™s required for a database to underpin mission-critical AI-powered applications.

Developers will no longer need to manage external embedding APIs, standalone vector stores, or complex search pipelines. AI retrieval will be built into the database itself, making semantic search, vector retrieval, and ranking as seamless as traditional queries.

For businesses, this translates to faster time-to-value and greater confidence in scaling AI applications. By delivering high-quality results at scale, enterprises can seamlessly integrate AI into their most critical use cases, ensuring reliability, performance, and real-world impact.

Looking ahead: What comes next
This is just the beginning. Our vision is to make MongoDB the most powerful and intuitive database for modern, AI-driven applications.

Voyage AIâ€™s models will soon be natively available in MongoDB Atlas.

We will continue evolving MongoDBâ€™s AI retrieval capabilities, making it smarter, more adaptable, and capable of handling a wider range of data types and use cases.
